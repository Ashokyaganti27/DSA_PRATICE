# 📘 DSA Practice Log

This is my daily practice tracker for Data Structures and Algorithms. I’m solving **3 problems every day** and learning DSA topic by topic in a clear, consistent way.

---

## 📅 Daily Practice Plan

- 🧠 Solve **3 problems per day**
  - Mix of Easy, Medium, and Hard
  - Rotating pattern: `2E+1M`, `2M+1E`, `1E+1M+1H`
- ✅ After solving, I study the next topic and repeat
- 💡 Focus is on understanding, not just solving

---

## ✅ Topics Covered So Far

- 🔍 Searching
- 📊 Sorting
- 🔁 Recursion
- 📌 Binary Search (with Lower & Upper Bound)

---

## Goal

Stay consistent, build strong foundations, and deeply understand each topic — one step at a time.

I commit code daily after solving 3 problems, along with the time of completion.
